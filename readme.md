## Inspiration

It's not always easy to find a reliable college guidance counselor. As a result of COVID-19 pandemic, this task has become even more difficult as students shifted to virtual learning.

### What is (A)IGO2COLLEGE

(A)IGO2COLLEGE (as in I-go-to-college) is a web-application designed to help students stay on top of the college application process in the absence of a college guidance counselor. It answers general questions pertaining to academics, tuition and fees, college application requirements, etc.

We took a rather unconventional approach for the UI that's easy to navigate even for internet novice. We tried to follow Facebooks principles of inclusivity to ensure no one is left out.

<!-- ## Quick Start
To use the application, try asking some of the following:

- "What gpa do I need to get into Harvard University?"

- "What sat score do I need to get into Stanford University?"

- "Am I still required to take the SAT for MIT?" -->

## Tasks

Application was trained on `550+ statements` based on the 2019 global ranking of universities. Goal was to train these statements well enough to respond to users with accurate information pertaining to their dream universities.

## What you can ask

Ask stuff like:

- What gpa do I need to get into Harvard University?

- What sat score do I need to get into Stanford University?

- Am I still required to take the SAT for UPENN?

## Dataset

Dataset is collected from a variety of sources with the most up-to-date information. Our databased was based on global ranking. The cutoff for the database was around rank 80.

## Technology

(A)IGO2College uses the wit.ai to better understand users query and provide them with reliable results.

We also use Fuzzy string matching as a last resort if  User get the University a letter wrong here or there.
## What's Next for us

### Some of our near-future plans

- Making the application more conversational and personalised.

- Expanding our database with more universities, including liberal arts colleges and community colleges.

- Adding information like what all majors are provided by the universities and offer a broader array of user specific solutions.

- Make an interactive dashboard for each user and give analysed results for what university they should apply to given their scores and achievements.

- Choice to link account with third party apps like google calendar to set reminder for important dates.

### Some of the not-so-near future plans

- Much of the college data wasn't that easily scrapable and not even search-able when we collected our data. Many universities don't keep their sites updated either. So we wish to kick-start this crowdsourced wikipedia-like information database so that people are more informed while applying to colleges.
